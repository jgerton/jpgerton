# Jon Gerton - Full-Stack Developer & Technical Consultant

> 27 years in tech: from sys/network admin to agency developer to solo founder. Builds production applications and mentors the next generation of developers.

## Background

Started in tech in 1998 as a Systems/Network Administrator for a regional airline, managing production infrastructure where uptime mattered. Transitioned to full-stack development in 2007 after recognizing software was the better fit for my skill set.

Spent 13 years (2007-2020) at three software development agencies, shipping projects across dozens of industries and tech stacks. When COVID hit and AI-assisted development started advancing rapidly, made the intentional move to solo founder - building an agency with a vision to mentor junior developers into sustainable career paths.

## Technical Expertise

**Primary Stack:**
- Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Convex, PostgreSQL, REST/GraphQL APIs
- Infrastructure: Vercel, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Linux administration
- Testing: TDD practices, automated testing, code review

**Additional Experience:**

## Philosophy

Meeting people where they are. A local pizza shop needs a clean site that shows up on Google, not a React app. A growing startup needs architecture that won't require a rewrite in two years. Different problems deserve different solutions.

Building an agency with intention - not just taking clients, but creating a path for junior developers to grow into their careers with real mentorship and production experience.
