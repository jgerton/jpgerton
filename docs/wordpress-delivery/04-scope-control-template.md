## Change Request Process

### Philosophy: "Yes, And..."

Never say "no" to a client request. Say "yes, and here's what it costs."

This positions Jon as helpful while protecting time and profitability.

### Change Request Steps

```
1. Client requests feature outside scope
           ↓
2. Jon acknowledges and clarifies requirement
           ↓
3. Jon provides written quote (email or message)
           ↓
4. Client approves in writing (email reply, signed form)
           ↓
5. Payment for additional work received
           ↓
6. Additional work begins
```

### Key Rules

1. **Never start additional work before written approval**
2. **Never start additional work before payment received**
3. **Document all changes in writing (email thread or change order form)**
4. **Update timeline if change affects delivery date**

### Sample Responses

**Client:** "Can we add an online store?"

> "Absolutely! E-commerce is outside the standard $500 package but I can add that for you. For a basic WooCommerce setup with up to 20 products, that would be an additional $500. Want me to send over a change order form?"

**Client:** "I'd like to see 5 more design options."

> "Happy to provide more options! The package includes 2 revision rounds. Additional revision rounds are $75 each. Want me to proceed with another round?"

**Client:** "Can you write blog posts for us?"

> "I'd recommend focusing on the core site first, then we can discuss a content package. Blog content is priced at $100 per post. I can also refer you to a dedicated copywriter if you need ongoing content."

## Contract Language Suggestions

Include these clauses in client agreements.

### Scope Definition Clause

> **Scope of Work:** This agreement covers the creation of a [X]-page WordPress website including: [list pages]. The website will include contact form functionality, mobile responsive design, and basic SEO optimization. Any features, functionality, or services not explicitly listed are outside the scope of this agreement.

### Change Order Clause

> **Changes to Scope:** Any work requested outside the defined scope requires a written change order. Client agrees that no additional work will begin until: (1) a change order is signed by both parties, and (2) payment for additional work is received. Changes may affect the project timeline.

### Approval Requirements Clause

> **Approval Process:** Client will be provided opportunities to review and approve work at defined milestones. Approval will be confirmed via email or signed form. Failure to respond within 5 business days will be treated as approval to proceed.

### Timeline Impact Clause

> **Timeline Adjustments:** The estimated completion date assumes timely client feedback and content delivery. Delays in client response or scope changes may extend the timeline proportionally. Jon will communicate any timeline changes in writing.

### Revision Limits Clause

> **Revision Policy:** This project includes [2] rounds of revisions for design and content. A revision round consists of a single consolidated list of changes. Additional revision rounds are available at $75 per round. Major changes that alter the project direction may require a change order.

## Scope Discussion Checklist

Use during discovery call to prevent scope creep.

### Before Quoting

- [ ] Is this a new site or redesign?
- [ ] How many pages do they actually need?
- [ ] Do they have content ready?
- [ ] Do they have a logo?
- [ ] Do they have brand colors?
- [ ] What's their timeline expectation?
- [ ] Do they need e-commerce? (If yes, different project)
- [ ] Do they need booking functionality? (If yes, quote add-on)
- [ ] Do they need ongoing maintenance? (If yes, quote retainer)

### Red Flags (Scope Creep Risk)

- "We're not sure what we want yet" - Nail down requirements before starting
- "Can you match [complex competitor site]?" - Set realistic expectations
- "We'll figure out the content as we go" - Require content before building
- "Budget is flexible" - Often means expectations exceed budget
- "We need it yesterday" - Rush = premium pricing or pass

### Green Flags (Good Fit)

- "We have our content ready"
- "Here's our logo and brand guide"
- "We've looked at your portfolio and like [specific example]"
- "5-7 pages is exactly what we need"
- "When can we start?"
