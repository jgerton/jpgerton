## Alaska-Specific Advantages

Alaska has some of the most favorable trust and asset protection laws in the US. A good Alaska attorney can leverage these:

| Feature | Alaska Advantage | Comparison |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **Dynasty Trusts** | Can last 1,000 years | Most states: 21-90 years |
| **Self-Settled Spendthrift Trusts** | Asset protection while alive | Few states allow this |
| **State Income Tax** | None | No tax on trust income |
| **Privacy** | Strong trust privacy laws | Better than many states |

**Key insight:** These advantages may eliminate the need to form LLC in Delaware/Wyoming - an Alaska attorney can structure things to get similar or better protection.

## Questions to Ask in Consultations

### Business Structure Questions

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| "For a solo software dev agency, what's the actual benefit of forming in Wyoming vs. Alaska?" | Tests practical knowledge vs. generic advice |
| "If I form in another state but operate from Alaska, what are the total costs and compliance requirements?" | Gets real numbers on multi-state complexity |
| "How do you integrate LLC structure with long-term estate planning?" | Tests holistic thinking |

### Legacy Planning Questions

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| "What's your experience with multi-generational business succession?" | Confirms legacy planning expertise |
| "Can you explain Alaska Dynasty Trusts and whether they'd benefit my situation?" | Tests Alaska-specific knowledge |
| "How would you structure things if my goal is building something that lasts for generations?" | Reveals their approach to long-term planning |

### Practical Questions

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| "What's your approach for a solo business that might grow over time?" | Ensures they can scale with you |
| "How do you handle ongoing relationship vs. one-time setup?" | You want a long-term advisor, not just a document preparer |
| "What's your fee structure - flat fee for formation vs. hourly for planning?" | Budget planning |
| "Do you review business contracts as part of your practice?" | Useful for client agreement review |

## Outreach Email Template

Use this template to request initial consultations:

**Subject:** Initial Consultation Request - Business Formation + Long-Term Planning

Hi,

I'm researching attorneys to help with business structuring and long-term planning for a software development agency I'm building in Alaska.

**Immediate needs:**
- LLC formation guidance (Alaska vs. other state considerations)
- Business contract review

**Long-term goals:**
- Building a business that can be passed down through generations
- Estate planning integrated with business structure
- Asset protection as the business grows

I'm looking for an attorney who thinks long-term and can be a trusted advisor as the business evolves, not just someone for one-time document preparation.

**About my situation:**
- Solo operator currently, with plans to grow
- Service-based business (WordPress development, potentially expanding to broader software services)
- Based in Alaska
- Focused on building something sustainable and generational

Would you have availability for an initial consultation to discuss whether we'd be a good fit? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
