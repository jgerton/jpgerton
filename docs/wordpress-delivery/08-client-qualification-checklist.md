## Red Flags

**Any one of these = strongly consider passing.** These patterns predict difficult projects.

### Scope Red Flags

| What They Say | What It Means | Risk Level |
|---------------|---------------|------------|

| "Can you match [complex competitor site]?" | Unrealistic expectations for $500 | HIGH |
| "We'll figure out the content as we go" | Content delays will kill the timeline | HIGH |
| "We just need a few small changes" | Scope minimization trap - "small" becomes large | MEDIUM |

### Budget Red Flags

| What They Say | What It Means | Risk Level |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| "Budget is flexible" | Often means expectations exceed any budget | MEDIUM |

### Timeline Red Flags

### Authority Red Flags

| What They Say | What It Means | Risk Level |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| "My partner/spouse/boss will need to approve" | Hidden decision-maker will derail approvals | HIGH |
| "Let me run this by the team" | Committee decision-making = slow and conflicting feedback | MEDIUM |
| "I'll need to check with..." | Not empowered to make decisions | MEDIUM |

### History Red Flags

| What They Say | What It Means | Risk Level |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| "Our last developer ghosted us" | They may be the common denominator | HIGH |

## Decline Scripts

Polite, professional ways to pass on bad-fit projects.

### For Scope Mismatch

> "Based on what you're describing, I think you'd be better served by an agency that handles more complex projects. My $500 package is optimized for straightforward 5-7 page sites. I can recommend a few options if you'd like."

### For Timeline Mismatch

> "My current schedule can't accommodate that timeline. My typical turnaround is 5-7 days from content approval. For faster turnaround, you might check Fiverr or Upwork where some designers specialize in quick delivery."

### For Budget Mismatch

> "The features you're describing - e-commerce, booking system, custom integrations - would be a custom project, typically in the $2,000-5,000 range. If that's outside your budget, I'd recommend DIY platforms like Squarespace or Wix for getting started."

### For Unrealistic Expectations

> "I want to make sure we're a good fit. The portfolio you referenced is from a company with a dedicated design team and a $50K budget. My $500 package delivers professional, clean results - but different than that. Let me show you examples that match what I deliver."

### General Pass

> "I appreciate you reaching out, but I don't think I'm the right fit for this project. I want to make sure you find someone who can deliver exactly what you need. Best of luck with it!"

### For Hidden Decision-Maker

> "Since your [partner/boss] will need to approve the design, I'd recommend including them in our next call. I've found projects go smoother when all decision-makers are aligned from the start. Let me know when everyone's available."
