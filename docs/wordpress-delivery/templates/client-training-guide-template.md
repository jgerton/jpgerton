## 6. What NOT to Touch

**IMPORTANT:** These areas can break your website. Please don't modify them.

### Do Not Change

|------|-----|
| **Plugins** | Deactivating or deleting plugins can break features like contact forms, security, and SEO |
| **Appearance > Themes** | Changing themes will completely change how your site looks |
| **Settings** | Changing Site URL or other settings can make your site inaccessible |
| **Users** | Don't delete the admin user or change user roles |
| **Kadence Settings** | Global design settings that affect the entire site |

*[Screenshot placeholder: Plugins page with "don't touch" callout]*

### What to Do Instead

If you need changes in any of these areas:

1. **Don't attempt it yourself**
2. **Email me** at support@jpgerton.com
3. **Describe what you want to achieve**
4. **I'll either walk you through it or make the change for you**

### Q: The website looks different on my phone. Is that normal?

**A:** Yes! Your website is "responsive," meaning it automatically adjusts to fit different screen sizes. This is intentional and helps mobile visitors have a good experience.

---

### Q: Someone hacked my website. What do I do?

**A:** Contact me immediately at support@jpgerton.com. Your site has security protections (Wordfence), but if something gets through, I can help restore it from backup.
