# Credential Follow-Up Email Templates

**Purpose:** Ensure secure credential transfer when initial one-time secret expires or client hasn't responded.

## Template 1: 7-Day Follow-Up (Secret Expired)

**Subject:** [Business Name] Website - New Hosting Credentials Link Needed

**When to send:** 7 days after sending one-time secret link with no response

---

Hi [Client Name],

I wanted to follow up on the hosting credentials for your [Business Name] website project.

The secure link I sent previously has expired (they're designed to do that for security). No worries - just send me a fresh set of credentials when you get a chance.

**What I need:**
- Hosting control panel login (cPanel, Plesk, or hosting dashboard)
- OR FTP/SFTP credentials if that's what you have access to

**How to send securely:**
Go to https://onetimesecret.com, paste your credentials, and send me the generated link. The link self-destructs after I view it.

If you're having trouble accessing your hosting account, let me know and I can help troubleshoot or contact your host on your behalf.

Thanks!
Jon

## Template 2: 14-Day Follow-Up (Project at Risk)

**Subject:** [Business Name] Website - Project on Hold Until Credentials Received

**When to send:** 14 days after initial request, still no credentials

---

Hi [Client Name],

I'm following up again about the hosting credentials for your [Business Name] website.

Your site is built and ready for migration, but I need your hosting login to deploy it. Without credentials, I can't move forward with the launch.

**Project Status:**
- Site is complete on staging
- Awaiting hosting credentials for migration
- Timeline resumes once I receive credentials

**Please send:**
1. Go to https://onetimesecret.com
2. Paste your hosting login (username + password)
3. Send me the generated link

If you're having trouble with your hosting account or need to set one up, let me know. I'm happy to recommend a host or help you get access.

Looking forward to getting your site live!

## Template 3: 30-Day Final Notice

**Subject:** [Business Name] Website - Final Notice Before Project Closure

**When to send:** 30 days after initial request, still waiting

---

Hi [Client Name],

I've been waiting on hosting credentials for your [Business Name] website project for about a month now.

Per our agreement, if I don't hear back within the next 7 days, I'll need to close out this project and move on to other work.

**What this means:**
- Your completed website will remain available for download
- If you want to continue later, we'll need to start with a new deposit
- The current staging site will be archived

**To keep the project active:**
Just send me your hosting credentials via one-time secret (https://onetimesecret.com) and I'll migrate your site within 48 hours.

If something's going on that's preventing you from moving forward, I understand - just let me know so we can figure out next steps.

Best,
Jon

## Template 4: Credential Receipt Confirmation

**Subject:** RE: [Business Name] - Credentials Received, Starting Migration

**When to send:** Immediately after receiving credentials

---

Hi [Client Name],

Got your hosting credentials - thanks for sending those!

I'm starting the migration now. Here's what happens next:

1. **Today:** I'll migrate your site to your hosting
2. **Within 24 hours:** You'll get an email confirming the site is live
3. **What to check:** I'll include a short checklist for you to verify everything looks good

If I run into any issues with your hosting, I'll reach out. Otherwise, expect good news soon!

## Template 5: Hosting Issues Found

**Subject:** [Business Name] Website - Hosting Issue Needs Resolution

**When to send:** When hosting doesn't meet requirements after checking credentials

---

Hi [Client Name],

I've logged into your hosting account and found an issue we need to resolve before migration:

**Problem:** [Describe specific issue]
- Example: "Your PHP version is 7.2, but WordPress requires 7.4 or higher"
- Example: "Your hosting memory limit is 128MB, which is below the 256MB minimum"

**Options:**

1. **You contact your host:** Ask them to upgrade [PHP version / memory limit / etc.]. Most hosts can do this for free.

2. **I contact them for you:** I can handle this as a change order ($50 flat fee) if you'd prefer.

3. **Switch hosts:** If your current host can't meet the requirements, I recommend [SiteGround/DreamHost] which costs $X/month and handles everything we need.

Let me know which option works for you, and I'll proceed accordingly.

## Notes

- Always use onetimesecret.com for credential transfer (expires after viewing)
- Never ask clients to email passwords in plain text
- If client sends credentials via email, immediately move them to password manager and ask them to change the password
- Document all follow-up attempts in client folder
