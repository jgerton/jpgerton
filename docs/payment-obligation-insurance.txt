how do I ensure the new clients are going to hold to their $500 obligation and not just take the site and avoid payment?

You protect yourself with structure: deposits, contracts, and control over launch access.

Concrete protections for a $500 site
50% upfront, 50% before go‑live

Take a non‑refundable 50% deposit before you start (you already planned this). This filters out non‑serious clients and covers your minimum time.

Make it explicit that the remaining 50% is due “upon completion, prior to launch or transfer of any files.”

Never launch before final payment

Keep the site on your own staging domain or on their host but behind a maintenance page until the final invoice is paid.
​

Your terms should say you won’t point DNS, remove the maintenance page, or hand over admin credentials until the balance is cleared.

Simple written agreement, every time

Use a short contract or service agreement that clearly states: total fee, what’s included, payment schedule (50/50), what “completion” means, and the “no launch before final payment” rule.

Include what happens if they delay content (e.g., project pauses, restart fee) and what happens if they don’t pay (you keep the site unpublished, late fees optional).

Ownership and access rules

State that you retain rights to the design/build until full payment is received, at which point license/ownership transfers to them.

Do not give them full admin access or downloadable backups until invoices are settled.

Use proper invoicing and easy payment methods

Send invoices through Stripe/Wave/PayPal with clear due dates and automatic reminders; many designers get paid faster just by making it simple to click and pay.

Keep everything in writing (email + signed agreement), so if someone pushes back you can calmly point to the agreed terms.

If you want, I can draft a lean “$500 site” payment clause you can paste into your contract and proposals so this is baked into every project by default.
