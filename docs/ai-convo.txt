This is a very strong, well-thought-out plan that’s absolutely compatible with a near‑zero budget start, with a few tweaks to sequencing and scope to keep costs at effectively $0 until you close clients.
​

What’s already excellent
Clear niche and offer: fixed‑scope, fixed‑price WordPress “digital business card” sites for local service businesses is focused and easy to pitch.
​

Tight productized service: 5–7 pages, specific features, clear exclusions, and a 5‑day delivery timeline keep scope creep under control.
​

Good revenue math and upsells: you’ve identified realistic throughput (2–8 sites/month) and clear upsells like maintenance, copywriting, GBP setup, etc.
​

Thoughtful lead system: the Google Maps–driven pipeline, hot/warm scoring, and outreach scripts show you understand where clients come from and how to contact them.
​

You don’t need a big budget to make this work; you mainly need your time and consistency.

Where it’s overbuilt for “day 0”
The plan reads like a v1.2 of a business, not a day‑zero version. For launch, a few elements are likely unnecessary overhead:

n8n + custom automation stack: setting up n8n hosting, SerpAPI, workflows, scrapers, etc. is great, but overkill before you’ve validated your outreach scripts in your own city with manual work.
​

Too many tools at once: email tools, CRM, Slack/Discord notifications, and JSON workflow exports add complexity without helping you get your first 3–5 clients.
​

Full file structure and scripts: scraper.py, website-checker.py, and detailed YAML specs are awesome once you’re scaling, but they’re not needed to close initial deals.
​

You can still keep all of this in your “Phase 2/3” roadmap, but your day‑zero ops can be much simpler.

How to run this on (almost) zero budget
You can launch this model with essentially just your time plus a few free tiers.

Core principle: validate by hand first, then automate the parts that are measurably painful.

Low‑budget version:

Prospecting (manual first):

Use Google Maps and Facebook manually for “[service] near [city]” and record leads in a simple Google Sheet with the same columns you defined (name, phone, website status, etc.).
​

Use your lead scoring logic (no site = hot, Facebook only/broken = warm, decent site = skip) but do it by eye.
​

Outreach stack (free):

Gmail + simple mail merge (e.g., Google Sheets + Gmail template) is enough before you hit volume limits.

Phone calls and Facebook Messenger are free and already part of your plan.
​

Delivery stack (free):

Use the free themes/plugins you already chose: Kadence/Astra/GeneratePress, Gutenberg, WPForms Lite, RankMath/Yoast, Wordfence, UpdraftPlus.
​

Let clients pay directly for hosting on SiteGround or similar; you just help them set it up during the intake call so you don’t front hosting costs.
​

Admin:

Contracts: use a 1‑page service agreement in Google Docs.

Invoicing: Stripe payment links or Wave (free) like you already suggest.
​

If you want “$0 until first client,” avoid paying for n8n hosting or SerpAPI at first; manual prospecting + free tiers is enough to test.

A simpler phased roadmap
Your roadmap is good, but for a low‑budget start I’d compress and reorder it:

Phase 0 (2–3 days): Bare‑bones setup
Create a simple one‑page credibility site for yourself (can be on yourlifecraft.com as a subpage) that shows 1–2 demo sites, your $500 offer, and a Calendly link (free).
​

Create:

Google Sheet for leads (columns from your plan).

One email template and one phone script (you already have these written).
​

Phase 1 (week 1): Manual validation
Manually find 50 hot/warm leads in your local area (Anchorage and nearby) via Google Maps and Facebook groups, log them in the sheet.
​

Call/email every lead using your existing scripts and track outcomes in the sheet (not a full CRM yet).
​

Aim for 1 closed client from those 50. Don’t build any automation before that.

Phase 2 (weeks 2–4): Systematize what worked
Once you’ve closed 1–3 sites and experienced where the friction is, pick the single worst bottleneck and automate that only:

If it’s “finding businesses without sites”: then start implementing your n8n + Google Places/SerpAPI workflow.

If it’s “following up”: build the outreach tracker workflow first instead.
​

Reinvest first profits into:

A low‑cost VPS or hosted n8n instance.

A basic email outreach tool if Gmail limits become an issue.
​

Phase 3 (after 5–10 clients): Improve offer and upsells
Turn maintenance into a default add‑on ($50–100/mo) and make it easy to accept in the proposal.
​

Create a standardized intake form and content request document to reduce back‑and‑forth.
​

Use testimonials and before/after screenshots on your site and in outreach.

A few strategic tweaks to make it “better”
Given that you’re building AI tools for businesses and have a blog, you can differentiate beyond “just another $500 WordPress shop” without adding cost:

Lean into “fast, AI‑assisted content”: optionally offer to draft their copy using AI based on a 20‑minute call, then have them approve it. You already list copywriting as an upsell; using AI helps you deliver it faster and cheaply.
​

Build blog content on yourlifecraft.com about your process:

“How I find local businesses who need websites (and what that means for your business)”

“The 5‑day website build: from zero to ‘send me your link’”
These posts double as marketing collateral you can link in outreach.

Offer a micro‑“audit” freebie:

For businesses with bad sites, send a 3‑bullet Loom video showing issues and how a simple $500 rebuild fixes them. It increases response rate and uses only your time.

If you’d like, next step we can:

Strip this document down into a “Day 0” version,

Then outline exactly what you should do in your first 7 days, hour by hour, on a no‑cash budget.

I plan on using my max claude code subscription to help automate and would also like to use it to build the websites to show the clients
Using your Max Claude Code subscription as the engine for both automation and site delivery fits this plan perfectly; it can replace a lot of the “Phase 2” complexity you wrote down and keep cash outlay near zero.

How to use Claude Code for automation
Use Claude Code as your “dev partner” and orchestrator, not as a fully autonomous system at first.

Lead-list building: have it generate and refine Python or JS scripts that scrape/search Google Maps–like directories, then export to CSV/Sheets; this is the same pattern people use for scraping and enrichment workflows.
​

Workflow glue: once a script works, ask Claude to wrap it in a simple CLI or scheduled job, and to integrate with n8n or HTTP webhooks only after your manual process is validated.

Iterative improvement: use Claude to debug and optimize scripts as you run into issues, instead of investing in complex infrastructure on day one.

This gives you the benefits of your automation vision without paying extra for dev time or SaaS tools early.

How to use Claude Code to build client sites
Treat Claude as a senior WordPress assistant that works inside your local dev setup.

Local workflow: run WordPress locally (e.g., Local by WP Engine or a Docker setup), open the project in VS Code, and keep a Claude Code session connected to that repo so it can read your theme files, plugins, and configuration.

Theme/customization help: ask Claude to scaffold child themes, create custom templates, or adjust hooks/filters; it’s strong at generating correct WordPress PHP and responsive layouts, though you should still review for performance and security.

AI-assisted content: feed Claude notes from your intake call and have it draft page copy (Home/About/Services/FAQ) that you then lightly edit; this becomes part of your “copywriting assistance” upsell at almost no marginal cost.

You still keep yourself in the loop for visual QA, performance, and avoiding outdated APIs, but your build time per site drops substantially.

A concrete flow for a $0–budget first client
Prospect manually for 20–30 businesses and log them in a Sheet.

Use Claude Code to:

Generate/refine a small script that checks which of those have missing/bad sites and tags them.

Draft personalized cold emails and call scripts based on that list.

Once someone is interested, spin up a local WordPress site, and ask Claude to:

Propose a layout, generate a starter theme/child theme, and draft initial copy.

Help you tweak CSS and templates until it matches what you want.

Deploy to their host, do a final manual QA, and collect payment; only then think about automating more of the lead-gen workflow.

If you’d like, I can outline a specific “Claude-first” stack and prompt patterns you can reuse for: lead scraping, outreach personalization, and WordPress build steps.

how do I ensure the new clients are going to hold to their $500 obligation and not just take the site and avoid payment?
You protect yourself with structure: deposits, contracts, and control over launch access.

Concrete protections for a $500 site
50% upfront, 50% before go‑live

Take a non‑refundable 50% deposit before you start (you already planned this). This filters out non‑serious clients and covers your minimum time.

Make it explicit that the remaining 50% is due “upon completion, prior to launch or transfer of any files.”

Never launch before final payment

Keep the site on your own staging domain or on their host but behind a maintenance page until the final invoice is paid.
​

Your terms should say you won’t point DNS, remove the maintenance page, or hand over admin credentials until the balance is cleared.

Simple written agreement, every time

Use a short contract or service agreement that clearly states: total fee, what’s included, payment schedule (50/50), what “completion” means, and the “no launch before final payment” rule.

Include what happens if they delay content (e.g., project pauses, restart fee) and what happens if they don’t pay (you keep the site unpublished, late fees optional).

Ownership and access rules

State that you retain rights to the design/build until full payment is received, at which point license/ownership transfers to them.

Do not give them full admin access or downloadable backups until invoices are settled.

Use proper invoicing and easy payment methods

Send invoices through Stripe/Wave/PayPal with clear due dates and automatic reminders; many designers get paid faster just by making it simple to click and pay.

Keep everything in writing (email + signed agreement), so if someone pushes back you can calmly point to the agreed terms.

If you want, I can draft a lean “$500 site” payment clause you can paste into your contract and proposals so this is baked into every project by default.
