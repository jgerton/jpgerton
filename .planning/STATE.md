**Current focus:** v1.1 Design Polish

## Current Position

Phase: 8 - Design Token Foundation
Plan: -
Status: Roadmap created, ready for phase planning
Last activity: 2026-02-04 - Roadmap created for v1.1 (7 phases, 23 plans)

Progress: [..................................] 0% v1.1

## Milestones

- v1.0 MVP - SHIPPED 2026-02-04 (7 phases, 39 plans)
- v1.1 Design Polish - ROADMAP CREATED 2026-02-04 (7 phases, 23 plan stubs)

## Performance Metrics

- v1.0: 7 phases, 39 plans, shipped 2026-02-04
- v1.1: 7 phases (8-14), 49 requirements mapped, 0/23 plans complete

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

- Phase numbering continues from v1.0 (Phase 8-14 for v1.1)
- Research recommends bottom-up approach: tokens first, validation last
- CSS-only animations preferred over Framer Motion to protect Lighthouse 100 score
- Composition over modification: extend shadcn/ui via CVA variants and wrapper components
- Lora + Inter font pairing for "approachable professional" brand personality
- GPU-accelerated properties only (transform, opacity) for all animations
- Parallel opportunities: Phase 9 and 10 can overlap, Phase 11 and 12 can overlap

### Research Flags

- Phase 10 (Typography & Color): WCAG contrast validation across all components in dark mode is complex
- Phase 12 (Animation): Integration approach for scroll-triggered animations needs careful performance monitoring
- Stack research recommends Framer Motion but REQUIREMENTS.md excludes it (out of scope, +50KB bundle). Use CSS animations instead.

### Todos

- None yet (roadmap just created)
