<current_state>
Phase 2 (Projects & Home) completed and verified. Ready to start Phase 3 (Services & Contact).

This is a clean transition point between phases - no work in progress.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## Phase 2: Projects & Home (COMPLETE)

- Plan 02-01: Convex schema, project queries, Next.js image config
- Plan 02-02: nuqs + portfolio components (ProjectCard, ProjectGrid, HeroSection, ProjectFilters)
- Plan 02-03: Page assembly (home, /projects, /projects/[slug])
- Plan 02-04: Seed 6 projects + visual verification checkpoint

**Verification:** 5/5 success criteria passed
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Phase 3: Services & Contact (NOT STARTED)

**Goal:** Local business owner can understand the $500 WordPress offer and book a discovery call.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Services page with 3 tiers, clear $500 pricing
2. $500 tier deliverables list (5-7 pages, mobile, contact form, maps, SEO)
3. Calendly booking button for $500 service
4. Contact form (name, email, message) with confirmation
5. Form submissions stored in Convex + email notification
6. About page with background/philosophy
7. Distinct CTAs per page (WordPress booking vs custom inquiry)

**Requirements:** PAGE-04, SERV-01-05, PAGE-05, CONT-01-05, PAGE-06
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

Key Phase 2 decisions that affect Phase 3:
- nuqs for URL state (can reuse for form state if needed)
- Convex for data storage (contact submissions will use same pattern)
- shadcn/ui components established (Button, Card, Badge available)
- Dark mode working (new pages must respect theme)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - clean transition point
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 2 executed smoothly with wave-based parallelization. Average plan time was 5.8 min.

Phase 3 will add conversion-focused pages. Key integration points:
- Calendly embed for $500 bookings
- Contact form with Convex mutations
- Email notification (likely Resend integration)

The portfolio is now live with 6 seeded projects (no screenshots yet - that's Phase 4 admin work).

Run `/gsd:discuss-phase 3` or `/gsd:plan-phase 3` to begin Phase 3.

Phase 3 needs planning - the ROADMAP.md only has "03-01: TBD during planning" as placeholder.
