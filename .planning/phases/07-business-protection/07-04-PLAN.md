<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify all documents exist and meet requirements</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run verification checks on all Phase 7 deliverables:

1. **Document Existence Check**
   Verify these files exist:
   - docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md
   - docs/wordpress-delivery/08-client-qualification-checklist.md
   - docs/wordpress-delivery/09-hosting-requirements.md
   - docs/wordpress-delivery/templates/project-termination-letter.md

2. **Content Requirements Check**
   For each document, verify key content:

   07-client-agreement-template.md:
   - [ ] Contains signature section
   - [ ] Contains payment terms (50/50 split)
   - [ ] Contains warranty section with exclusions
   - [ ] Contains termination clause
   - [ ] Contains limitation of liability

   08-client-qualification-checklist.md:
   - [ ] Contains must-have qualifications
   - [ ] Contains red flags section
   - [ ] Contains green flags section
   - [ ] Contains decline scripts
   - [ ] Contains decision matrix

   09-hosting-requirements.md:
   - [ ] Contains PHP version requirements
   - [ ] Contains MySQL version requirements
   - [ ] Contains memory limit requirements
   - [ ] Contains hosting provider comparison
   - [ ] Contains change order reference for troubleshooting

   templates/project-termination-letter.md:
   - [ ] Contains multiple termination scenarios
   - [ ] Contains refund calculation guidance
   - [ ] Contains letter templates
   - [ ] Contains post-termination protocol

   05-payment-protection.md (updated):
   - [ ] Contains precise bug definition examples
   - [ ] Contains "not covered" examples with spam, nephew scenarios
   - [ ] Contains key question decision framework
   - [ ] Contains warranty dispute resolution

3. **Cross-Reference Check**
   Verify documents reference each other appropriately:
   - Agreement template should reference termination protocol
   - Qualification checklist should reference agreement
   - Hosting requirements should reference staging guide
   - Termination letter should reference agreement terms

4. **Consistency Check**
   Verify no contradictions:
   - Payment terms match across all documents (50/50, $500 total)
   - Warranty period consistent (30 days)
   - Revision rounds consistent (2 included)
   - Hourly rate consistent ($50/hour)
   - Retainer rate consistent ($75/month)

Generate a verification report summarizing findings.

  <what-built>
Complete business protection documentation system:
1. Client agreement template - signable contract
2. Client qualification checklist - go/no-go filter
3. Hosting requirements document - technical specs
4. Project termination protocol - exit ramp
5. Updated warranty definitions - precise bug examples
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Review each document in docs/wordpress-delivery/:

1. **07-client-agreement-template.md**
   - Open and read through the agreement
   - Verify it covers: scope, payment, timeline, revisions, warranty, liability, termination
   - Check that it's signable (has signature fields)
   - Confirm language is professional but not intimidating

2. **08-client-qualification-checklist.md**
   - Review red flags - do they match your experience with problem clients?
   - Review green flags - do they describe your ideal client?
   - Check decline scripts - are they polite but firm?
   - Would you feel comfortable using this during a discovery call?

3. **09-hosting-requirements.md**
   - Verify PHP/MySQL requirements are current
   - Check hosting provider table - any you'd add or remove?
   - Review conversation scripts - do they match your communication style?

4. **templates/project-termination-letter.md**
   - Review termination scenarios - are they comprehensive?
   - Check refund calculations - are they fair to both parties?
   - Read letter templates - would you use these as-is?

5. **05-payment-protection.md** (updated sections)
   - Find the new "Precise Bug Definition Examples" section
   - Review the "covered" vs "not covered" examples
   - Check the "key question" framework - is it clear?
   - Review warranty dispute resolution - does this work for you?

**Key Questions to Consider:**
- Would you feel protected using these documents with a real client?
- Are there any scenarios these documents don't cover?
- Is the language clear enough for small business owners?
- Do the documents work together as a system?
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if documents are ready for use.
Or describe any changes needed (specific document + issue).
