<objective>
Create client qualification checklist and hosting requirements documents.

Purpose: Prevent taking on nightmare clients by establishing a go/no-go filter before quoting. Prevent migration time overruns by documenting hosting requirements upfront.

Output: Two documents - (1) qualification checklist with red/green flags for client conversations, (2) hosting requirements with specific technical specs.

  <name>Task 1: Create client qualification checklist</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/08-client-qualification-checklist.md</files>
  <action>
Create a practical client qualification checklist with these sections:

1. **Header**
   - Purpose: Filter for good-fit clients before quoting $500
   - When to use: During/after discovery call, before sending agreement

2. **Must-Have Qualifications** (all must be YES to proceed)
   - [ ] Client has content ready OR understands content add-on pricing
   - [ ] Client has hosting OR is open to Jon's hosting recommendations
   - [ ] Client is the sole decision-maker OR all decision-makers are aligned
   - [ ] Client understands what 5-7 pages means (showed examples)
   - [ ] Timeline expectation aligns with Jon's availability (5-7 days minimum)
   - [ ] Client accepts 50% deposit requirement

3. **Red Flags** (any one = strong consider passing)
   - "We're not sure what we want yet" - Undefined scope = endless revisions
   - "Can you match [complex competitor site]?" - Unrealistic expectations for $500
   - "We'll figure out the content as we go" - Content delays kill projects
   - "Budget is flexible" - Often means expectations exceed any budget
   - "We need it yesterday" - Rush = premium pricing or pass
   - "My partner/spouse/boss will need to approve" - Hidden decision-maker
   - "Can we start now and figure out payment later?" - Payment problems ahead
   - "Our last developer ghosted us" - May be the common denominator
   - "We just need a few small changes" - Scope minimization trap
   - Difficulty committing to discovery call time - Availability issues ahead

4. **Green Flags** (signals of a good-fit client)
   - "We have our content ready"
   - "Here's our logo and brand guide"
   - "We've looked at your portfolio and like [specific example]"
   - "5-7 pages is exactly what we need"
   - "When can we start?"
   - Quick, decisive responses to questions
   - Asks about timeline and process (professional mindset)
   - Has realistic expectations ("we don't need anything fancy")
   - Previous positive experience with freelancers/agencies

5. **Decision Matrix**
   | Scenario | Decision |
   |----------|----------|
   | All must-haves YES, no red flags | Proceed - send agreement |
   | All must-haves YES, 1-2 minor red flags | Proceed with caution - address concerns in writing |
   | Missing 1 must-have | Address before proceeding - don't proceed until resolved |
   | Multiple red flags | Polite decline - refer to another provider |
   | Major red flag (payment issues, hidden decision-maker) | Firm decline - protect your time |

6. **Decline Scripts** (polite ways to say no)
   - For scope mismatch: "Based on what you're describing, I think you'd be better served by [agency/other freelancer who handles complex projects]. My $500 package is really optimized for straightforward 5-7 page sites."
   - For timeline mismatch: "My current schedule can't accommodate that timeline. I'd recommend checking [Fiverr/other resource] for faster turnaround."
   - For budget mismatch: "The features you're describing would be a custom project, typically $X-Y range. If that's outside your budget, I'd recommend [DIY options like Squarespace/Wix]."
   - General pass: "I don't think I'm the right fit for this project, but I wish you the best with it!"

7. **Quick Reference Scorecard**
   Simple scoring: Green flags (+1), Red flags (-1), Must-haves (required)
   Score 3+ with all must-haves = Great fit
   Score 0-2 with all must-haves = Proceed with documented expectations
   Score negative or missing must-haves = Pass

Format with clear checkboxes and practical examples. This should be usable during a live call.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create hosting requirements document</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/09-hosting-requirements.md</files>
  <action>
Create a hosting requirements document with these sections:

1. **Header**
   - Purpose: Verify client hosting meets WordPress requirements before migration
   - When to use: After agreement signed, before migration attempt

2. **Minimum Requirements** (site won't work without these)
   - PHP 7.4 minimum (8.0+ recommended, 8.1 or 8.2 ideal)
   - MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.3+
   - HTTPS/SSL certificate (free Let's Encrypt acceptable)
   - 256MB PHP memory limit minimum (512MB recommended)
   - 64MB max upload size minimum
   - mod_rewrite enabled (for pretty permalinks)

3. **Recommended Requirements** (for good performance)
   - PHP 8.1 or 8.2
   - SSD storage (not HDD)
   - 50MB+ available disk space
   - GZIP compression enabled
   - Caching support (server-level or compatible with plugins)

4. **How to Check Requirements**
   - In cPanel: PHP Selector, MySQL version in phpMyAdmin
   - Ask hosting support: "What PHP version and memory limit do you offer?"
   - Create phpinfo() page to verify settings
   - Simple phpinfo script to upload and check

5. **Common Hosting Providers - Quick Reference**
   | Provider | PHP | Memory | SSL | Notes |
   |----------|-----|--------|-----|-------|
   | SiteGround | 8.1+ | 768MB+ | Free | Recommended for WordPress |
   | Bluehost | 8.0+ | 256MB | Free | Adequate, can be slow |
   | GoDaddy | 8.0+ | 256MB | Paid | Often needs upgrades |
   | HostGator | 7.4+ | 256MB | Free | Basic, works |
   | DreamHost | 8.1+ | 256MB+ | Free | Good value |
   | WP Engine | 8.1+ | 512MB+ | Free | Premium, excellent |
   | Cheap shared hosting | Varies | Often 128MB | Varies | Check carefully |

6. **What to Do If Hosting Fails Requirements**
   - Document specific failures
   - Present to client BEFORE migration attempt
   - Options:
     a. Client upgrades hosting plan (their cost)
     b. Client switches to recommended host (their cost, Jon can assist as change order)
     c. Jon provides hosting recommendation and client handles migration independently
   - Change order required if Jon assists with hosting troubleshooting

7. **Hosting Check Conversation Script**
   Template email to send before migration:
   "Before I migrate your site, I need to verify your hosting meets WordPress requirements. Can you send me:
   1. Your hosting provider name and plan level
   2. cPanel/hosting panel login (I'll use one-time secret for security)

   Alternatively, can you check with your host:
   - PHP version (need 7.4+, prefer 8.0+)
   - PHP memory limit (need 256MB minimum)
   - MySQL version (need 5.7+)
   - SSL certificate available (need HTTPS)

   If any of these don't meet specs, we'll discuss options before I attempt migration."

8. **Problem Scenario Responses**
   - "My hosting says 128MB memory limit" -> "That's below WordPress minimums. You'll need to upgrade your plan or switch hosts. Here are my recommendations..."
   - "They're running PHP 7.2" -> "That's outdated and insecure. Most hosts can upgrade PHP version in the control panel. Here's how..."
   - "SSL costs extra" -> "Free SSL is standard now. Consider switching to [host] which includes it, or the $50-100/year may be worth it for SEO."
   - "I don't know how to check" -> "No problem - share your hosting login via one-time secret and I'll verify for you."

Include a simple checklist version at the end for quick reference during migration prep.
