  <name>Task 1: Create project termination protocol and letter template</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/templates/project-termination-letter.md</files>
  <action>
Create a comprehensive project termination document with these sections:

1. **Header**
   - Purpose: Clean exit ramp for projects that aren't working
   - Philosophy: End relationships professionally, protect both parties

2. **When to Consider Termination**
   - Client is abusive or disrespectful (insults, threats, harassment)
   - Client is endlessly demanding beyond scope (ignores change order process)
   - Client disappears for 60+ days (covered in payment protection, reference)
   - Client refuses to pay per agreement terms
   - Client makes repeated late-night/weekend demands despite boundaries
   - Fundamental misalignment on project direction that can't be resolved
   - Jon's circumstances change (illness, emergency, capacity issues)

3. **Termination Scenarios and Protocols**

   **Scenario A: Client-Initiated Termination (Before Work Starts)**
   - Deposit: Non-refundable (covers reserved time)

5. **Termination Letter Templates**

   **Template A: Jon Terminating Due to Client Behavior**
   Subject: [Business Name] Project - Project Termination

   Hi [Client Name],

   After careful consideration, I've decided to end our project engagement for [Business Name].

   [Choose appropriate reason - keep professional:]
   - "The project requirements have evolved beyond the original scope, and I don't believe I'm the right fit to deliver what you're looking for."
   - "Given the communication challenges we've experienced, I think it's best for both of us to part ways."
   - "Our working styles don't seem to be aligned, and I want to make sure you work with someone who's a better match."

   Per our agreement, here's what happens next:

   1. REFUND: I'm processing a refund of $[amount] to your original payment method. This should appear within 5-7 business days.

   2. COMPLETED WORK: I've attached all work completed to date:
      - [List files/exports]
      - [Any staging site access if applicable]

   3. NEXT STEPS: You're free to use this work with another developer. I'd recommend [optional: referral to another developer who might be better fit].

   I wish you the best with your project.

   Best regards,
   Jon Gerton

   **Template B: Client-Initiated Termination Acknowledgment**
   Subject: RE: [Business Name] Project Cancellation Confirmed

   Hi [Client Name],

   I've received your request to cancel the [Business Name] website project.

   Per our agreement:

   1. DEPOSIT: The $250 deposit is non-refundable as it covered the discovery process, initial setup, and reserved project time.

   2. COMPLETED WORK: [If applicable] I've attached what was completed:
      - [List files]

   3. PROJECT CLOSED: The project is now officially closed. [If staging site exists] The staging site will be removed within 7 days.

   If circumstances change and you'd like to restart in the future, feel free to reach out. A new deposit would be required.

   Wishing you the best.

   **Template C: Jon Terminating Due to Personal Circumstances**
   Subject: [Business Name] Project - Unable to Continue

   Hi [Client Name],

   I'm reaching out with difficult news. Due to [personal circumstances / unexpected situation], I'm unable to continue with the [Business Name] website project.

   I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this causes. Here's what I'm doing to make this right:

   1. FULL REFUND: I'm processing a complete refund of your $250 deposit. This should appear within 5-7 business days.

   2. COMPLETED WORK: I've attached everything that was in progress:
      - [List files]

   3. REFERRAL: I'd recommend reaching out to [developer name/resource] who does similar work and may be able to help.

   Again, I'm sorry for the disruption. Thank you for your understanding.

   Best regards,
   Jon Gerton

6. **Post-Termination Protocol**
   - Do not engage in back-and-forth arguments
   - Keep all communication professional and documented
   - If client becomes hostile: "I've provided everything per our agreement. I won't be engaging further."
   - Block if harassment continues
   - Save all correspondence in case of disputes

7. **Prevention Notes**
   - Most terminations are preventable with good qualification (reference 08-client-qualification-checklist.md)
   - Early red flags should be addressed, not ignored
   - Clear agreements prevent most disputes (reference 07-client-agreement-template.md)

  <name>Task 2: Strengthen warranty/bug definitions in payment protection</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/05-payment-protection.md</files>
  <action>
Update the "30-Day Bug Fix Warranty" section in 05-payment-protection.md to add a new subsection with precise bug definitions. Find the existing warranty section and ADD this content after the current "What IS Covered" and "What is NOT Covered" tables:

ADD NEW SECTION: "### Precise Bug Definition Examples"

This section clarifies the fuzzy definitions with specific real-world examples:

**COVERED - These ARE bugs (Jon fixes free within 30 days):**

| Situation | Why It's Covered |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Contact form was receiving emails at launch, now it isn't" | Functionality regression with no client changes |
| "Page layout broke on mobile (was working at launch)" | Display regression, Jon's responsibility |
| "Images stopped displaying (no changes made by client)" | Content regression, Jon's responsibility |
| "Internal link goes to 404 now (page wasn't moved)" | Link regression, Jon's responsibility |
| "Footer appears twice on one page" | Bug introduced during build |
| "Form shows error message on valid submission" | Functionality bug |

**NOT COVERED - These are NOT bugs (require paid support):**

| Situation | Why It's NOT Covered | What To Do |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| "Contact form emails going to spam" | Email deliverability is hosting/email provider issue, not website bug | Client contacts hosting support, or Jon assists at $50/hr |
| "Site is slow" | Hosting performance, not website bug | Client upgrades hosting, or Jon optimizes at $50/hr |
| "Plugin update broke something" | Client-initiated change caused issue | Jon fixes at $50/hr |
| "My nephew tried to help and now it's broken" | Client-caused damage | Jon fixes at $50/hr |
| "I changed a setting and now X doesn't work" | Client-caused issue | Jon fixes at $50/hr |
| "New feature request (add a blog, add a page)" | Feature request, not bug | Change order required |
| "Content change (update phone number)" | Content maintenance, not bug | $50/hr or retainer |
| "The colors look different on my monitor" | Hardware variance, not bug | Not actionable |
| "It looked fine last week but now I don't like it" | Design preference, not bug | Revision round ($75) |
| "WordPress sent me an update notice" | Normal WP behavior, not bug | Client ignores or Jon handles on retainer |
| "My SSL certificate expired" | Hosting/domain responsibility | Client renews, or Jon assists at $50/hr |
| "My domain expired" | Domain registrar responsibility | Client renews ASAP |
| "Google says my site isn't indexed" | SEO is ongoing, not launch bug | SEO services quoted separately |

**THE KEY QUESTION:** "Did this work correctly at launch, and did it stop working without the client making changes?"
- YES to both = Bug, covered under warranty
- NO to either = Not a bug, paid support required

ADD to the end of the warranty section:

**Warranty Dispute Resolution**

If there's disagreement about whether something is covered:
1. Jon will explain the reasoning in writing
2. Jon will offer to fix at hourly rate ($50/hr) if client disagrees with assessment
3. If client insists it's a bug: Jon may fix as goodwill gesture (one time only)
4. Document the decision for future reference

**Warranty Claim Response Template:**

For covered bugs:
> "Thanks for reporting this. I've confirmed this is a warranty item (functionality that was working at launch). I'll have it fixed within [timeframe]."

For non-covered items:
> "Thanks for reaching out. After reviewing, this falls outside the warranty coverage because [specific reason - e.g., 'it's a content change' or 'the issue was caused by a plugin you installed']. I'm happy to fix this for you at my standard rate of $50/hour. Want me to proceed?"

ALSO: Update the existing "What is NOT Covered" table to include these additional items if not present:
- Auto-updates causing issues
- Third-party plugin/theme conflicts
- Changes made by client or client's team
- Hosting provider issues
- Email delivery problems
- Domain/DNS issues
