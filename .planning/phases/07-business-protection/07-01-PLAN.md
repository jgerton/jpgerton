<objective>
Create a complete, signable client agreement template for $500 WordPress projects.

Purpose: Convert the scattered "contract language suggestions" from Phase 6 into an actual agreement document that can be signed via HelloSign or similar e-signature service. This is the #1 priority protection against nightmare clients.

Output: A professional 1-2 page agreement template covering scope of work, payment terms, timeline, revision limits, warranty definition, limitation of liability, and termination clause.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create client agreement template document</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md</files>
  <action>
Create a professional client agreement template with these sections:

1. **Header and Parties**
   - Agreement title: "Website Development Agreement"
   - Date field, client name/business, Jon's business info
   - Project description field (fill-in-the-blank for specific project)

2. **Scope of Work** (from 04-scope-control-template.md)
   - Number of pages (default: 5-7)
   - List of standard deliverables
   - Explicit "not included" statement referencing exclusions
   - Statement: "Any work not explicitly listed requires a change order"

3. **Payment Terms** (from 05-payment-protection.md)
   - 50% deposit due upon signing ($250)
   - 50% final payment due before launch ($250)
   - Total: $500 USD
   - Payment method: Stripe invoice
   - Non-refundable deposit clause (covers discovery and reserved time)

4. **Timeline**
   - Estimated delivery: 5-7 business days from content receipt
   - Client delay clause: Jon's availability becomes first-come-first-served
   - Force majeure clause (simple version)

5. **Client Responsibilities**
   - Provide content within [X] days of contract signing
   - Provide logo, brand colors, and photos
   - Respond to review requests within 5 business days
   - Provide hosting credentials when requested

6. **Revision Policy**
   - 2 revision rounds included
   - Additional rounds: $75/round or $50/hour
   - Definition of "revision round" (single consolidated list)
   - Major direction changes may require change order

7. **Warranty and Support** (from 05-payment-protection.md, tightened)
   - 30-day warranty from launch date
   - Covers: Functionality that worked at launch but stopped working
   - NOT covered (explicit list):
     - Content changes
     - New features
     - Client-caused issues (plugin installs, code edits, setting changes)
     - Hosting/server issues
     - Third-party service issues (email delivery, domain expiration)
     - Plugin updates that break functionality
   - Post-warranty support: $50/hour or $75/month retainer

8. **Limitation of Liability**
   - Jon's total liability limited to amount paid under agreement
   - No liability for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages
   - No liability for client's lost profits or business
   - Client responsible for backing up their own data post-handoff

9. **Intellectual Property**
   - Upon full payment, client owns the website design and content
   - Jon retains right to display work in portfolio (unless client opts out in writing)
   - Third-party elements (stock photos, plugins) subject to their own licenses

10. **Termination**
    - Either party may terminate with written notice
    - If client terminates: Deposit non-refundable, work-to-date delivered
    - If Jon terminates: Prorated refund of deposit based on work completed
    - Reference to detailed termination protocol

11. **Signatures**
    - Client signature and date
    - Jon signature and date
    - "By signing, both parties agree to the terms above"
    - Note about e-signature validity

Format as professional markdown with clear section headers. Use fill-in-the-blank format: [Client Name], [Project Description], [Date], etc.

Keep language clear and non-intimidating - this is for small business owners, not corporate legal departments.

  <name>Task 2: Create usage instructions section</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md</files>
  <action>
Add a "How to Use This Agreement" section at the TOP of the document (before the actual agreement template):

1. **When to Send**
   - After discovery call, before deposit invoice
   - Send as PDF or via e-signature service
   - Never begin work without signed agreement

2. **E-Signature Options** (recommendations)
   - HelloSign (free for 3 docs/month)
   - DocuSign (industry standard, paid)
   - PandaDoc (good for proposals, paid)
   - Alternative: Client prints, signs, scans back

3. **Customization Checklist**
   - [ ] Fill in client name and business name
   - [ ] Specify number of pages (5-7 default)
   - [ ] List specific pages to be created
   - [ ] Set content delivery deadline
   - [ ] Confirm project start date
   - [ ] Review and adjust any project-specific terms

4. **Storage**
   - Keep signed copy in client folder
   - Never delete signed agreements
   - Reference agreement in any disputes

Use a clear separator (---) between instructions and the actual agreement template.

Run these checks after task completion:

1. Document structure:
   - grep -c "^##" docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md (should show 10+ sections)
   - grep "SIGNATURE" docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md

2. Critical clauses present:
   - grep -i "deposit" docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md
   - grep -i "warranty" docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md
   - grep -i "liability" docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md
   - grep -i "termination" docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md

3. Warranty exclusions (tightened per critical analysis):
   - grep -i "client-caused" docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md
   - grep -i "plugin update" docs/wordpress-delivery/07-client-agreement-template.md
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Client agreement template is complete and signable
- All critical protection clauses from Phase 6 are consolidated
- Warranty exclusions are explicit (addressing "fuzzy bug definition" gap)
- Document is professional but not intimidating (1-2 page equivalent)
- Usage instructions make implementation straightforward
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-business-protection/07-01-SUMMARY.md`
