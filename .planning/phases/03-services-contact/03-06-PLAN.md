          <p>
            I've spent over a decade building web applications - from startup MVPs to
            enterprise platforms serving millions of users. Along the way, I discovered
            something surprising: the most rewarding work isn't always the most complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I helped a friend launch his local plumbing business online, the impact
            was immediate. New customers called. His schedule filled up. His family's
            financial stress eased. That's when I realized there's a massive gap between
            "big tech" web development and what local businesses actually need.

        {/* My Approach Section */}
        <section className="mb-12">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">My Approach</h2>
          <p>
            I believe in meeting people where they are. For a local pizza shop, that means
            a clean, fast website that shows up on Google - not a complex custom application.
            For a growing startup, it means scalable architecture that won't need a rewrite
            in two years.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why I offer both <strong>$500 WordPress sites</strong> for local businesses
            and <strong>custom web applications</strong> for companies with unique needs.
            Different problems deserve different solutions.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Beyond the Code</h2>
          <p>
            When I'm not building websites, you'll find me mentoring junior developers,
            contributing to open source, or exploring hiking trails with my family.
            I'm a firm believer that sustainable work leads to better outcomes -
            for clients, for teams, and for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also run workshops for engineering teams on topics like testing practices,
            code review culture, and building psychologically safe teams. If your
            organization is looking to level up, I'd love to chat.

Key decisions per CONTEXT.md:
- Structured sections format (Background, Approach, Why Me, Beyond Code)
- No photo initially - text only
- Tone: Mix of professional credentials with conversational writing
- Dual CTAs: Primary "Book a call" (Calendly), Secondary "View my work" (Projects)
- "Why Work With Me" uses card grid for scannability
- Quick stats at bottom for credibility
- Prose styles for readable long-form content
- Client component for Calendly button
