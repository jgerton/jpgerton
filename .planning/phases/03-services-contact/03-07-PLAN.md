<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Phase 3 conversion pages: Services with pricing tiers, Contact with form + Calendly, and About with structured content.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Setup:** Ensure dev environment running (`docker compose up`)

**1. Services Page (http://localhost:3400/services)**
- [ ] 3 pricing cards displayed in grid
- [ ] $500 WordPress tier visually highlighted (scaled up, shadow, "Most Popular" badge)
- [ ] Benefits are outcome-focused (e.g., "Get online in 5 days" not "5-7 pages")
- [ ] Click "$500 Site" CTA - Calendly popup opens
- [ ] Click "Discuss Your Project" - navigates to /contact
- [ ] Trust stats visible at bottom (5 Days, 100%, 10+ Years)
- [ ] Toggle dark mode - all text readable

**2. Contact Page (http://localhost:3400/contact)**
- [ ] Two-column layout: form on left, booking on right (stacks on mobile)
- [ ] Contact form renders all 4 fields (name, email, project type, message)
- [ ] Click "Schedule a Call" - Calendly popup opens
- [ ] Social links visible (email, GitHub, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Submit form with invalid data - validation errors appear
- [ ] Submit form with valid data - redirects to /contact/thank-you

**3. Thank-You Page (http://localhost:3400/contact/thank-you)**
- [ ] Check icon and confirmation message visible
- [ ] "What Happens Next" steps numbered 1-2-3
- [ ] "View My Portfolio" button links to /projects
- [ ] "Back to Home" link works

**4. About Page (http://localhost:3400/about)**
- [ ] "Hey, I'm Jon" heading visible
- [ ] Structured sections: Background, My Approach, Why Work With Me, Beyond Code
- [ ] "Why Work With Me" shows 4 cards in grid
- [ ] Click "Book a Call" - Calendly popup opens
- [ ] Click "View My Work" - navigates to /projects
- [ ] Stats section at bottom (10+, 50+, 100%)

**5. Navigation Integration**
- [ ] Can navigate between all pages without errors
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works on all pages
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools

**Critical verification:**
- Calendly popup must actually open (not just navigate)
- Form submission must redirect to thank-you (test with real data)
