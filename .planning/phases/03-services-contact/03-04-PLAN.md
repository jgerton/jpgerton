- Side-by-side cards layout with $500 tier highlighted (scale + shadow)
- Benefit-focused bullets (outcomes not features)

- Calendly popup for $500 booking (keeps user in context)
- Contact page redirect for custom/consulting inquiries
- Trust section with key stats at bottom
- Secondary Calendly CTA for undecided visitors

Calendly URL is placeholder - user will provide actual URL.
