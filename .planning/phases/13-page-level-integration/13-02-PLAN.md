<objective>
Apply strategic CTA placement and dual CTA design across Services, About, and Contact pages with visual hierarchy improvements.

Purpose: Services and About are the second-most important pages for conversion. Services must lead with pricing transparency and use visually differentiated CTAs (warm/amber for WordPress, blue outline for custom). About must build trust through process focus. Contact gets lighter treatment but needs visual consistency. All three pages need alternating gradient/neutral section backgrounds and benefit-focused copy.

Output: Three redesigned pages using section components from Plan 01, with strategic CTA placement following page-appropriate rules (full treatment for Services, lighter for About and Contact).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign Services page with pricing-first layout and dual CTAs</name>
  <files>
    app/services/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Rewrite app/services/page.tsx with the pricing-first approach and strategic CTA placement from CONTEXT.md.

The page stays "use client" because it uses useRouter for contact navigation and CalendlyButton requires client-side DOM.

**Page structure:**

**Section 1: Hero (neutral background)**
- Keep as simple centered header (no gradient needed, pricing IS the hero here)
- h1: font-serif font-semibold text-h1 leading-tight mb-md - "Transparent Pricing, Professional Results"
- Subheadline: text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto - "No hidden fees. No surprise invoices. Choose the right solution for your business."
- Wrap in SectionBackground variant="neutral" (or just keep padding consistent with py-2xl)

**Section 2: Pricing Cards (gradient background for emphasis)**
- Wrap in SectionBackground variant="gradient" (pricing is the star)
- Keep existing PricingCards component with serviceTiers data
- IMPORTANT: Update the pricing tier CTA text to be benefit-focused:
  - WordPress tier cta: "Get Your Business Online" (was "Book Your $500 Site Call")
  - Custom apps tier cta: "Discuss Your Vision" (was "Discuss Your Project")
  - Mentoring tier cta: "Level Up Your Team" (was "Learn More")
- Update CalendlyButton rendering to use CTAButton intent="warm" styling when possible, OR update the CalendlyButton's className to match warm styling for the WordPress tier. Since CalendlyButton is a third-party popup wrapper, add className with warm button colors: "bg-accent-warm text-accent-warm-foreground hover:bg-accent-warm/90"
- For contact-action tiers, use Button variant="outline" (blue outline for custom inquiry) to differentiate from warm WordPress CTA
- This creates maximum visual differentiation: warm amber solid (WordPress) vs blue outline (custom/mentoring)

**Section 3: What's Included (neutral background)**
- NEW section between pricing and FAQ
- SectionBackground variant="neutral"
- h2: font-serif text-h2 leading-tight text-center mb-xl - "What Every WordPress Site Includes"
- Grid of 4 feature highlights (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-lg, max-w-3xl mx-auto):
  - "Mobile-Responsive Design" - "Looks great on every device, from phones to desktops."
  - "SEO Foundation" - "Basic search optimization so customers can find you on Google."
  - "Contact Form" - "Let customers reach you 24/7, even when you're closed."
  - "Content Training" - "Learn to update your own site with a simple walkthrough."
- Each feature: text-left with h3 font-semibold mb-xs and p text-sm text-muted-foreground

**Section 4: FAQ (muted background)**
- Wrap in SectionBackground variant="muted"
- Keep existing faqData array and FAQ rendering
- h2: font-serif text-h2 leading-tight mb-xl text-center
- FAQ cards: max-w-3xl mx-auto, grid gap-lg

**Section 5: Mid-page CTA**
- After FAQ, add a MidPageCTA variant="card" with:
  - headline: "Ready to Get Started?"
  - description: "Book a free 15-minute call to discuss your project."
  - CTA: CalendlyButton with warm styling for WordPress focus
  - Wrap in SectionBackground variant="neutral" with py-2xl

**Section 6: Trust Stats (use SocialProofDisplay)**
- Replace the manual trust stats grid with SocialProofDisplay component
- metrics: [{ value: "5 Days", label: "Average WordPress Delivery" }, { value: "100%", label: "Satisfaction Guarantee" }, { value: "18+ Years", label: "Web Development Experience" }]
- Wrap in SectionBackground variant="gradient" for visual weight

**Section 7: End-page CTA Banner**
- CTABanner with:
  - headline: "Let's Get Your Business Online"
  - description: "A professional website is the first step to reaching more customers. Let's make it happen."
  - primaryCta: { text: "Get Your Business Online", href: "/contact", intent: "warm" }
  - secondaryCta: { text: "View My Work", href: "/projects" }

**Keep:** FAQSchema and ServiceSchema at the bottom.

**Imports needed:**
- SectionBackground from "@/components/portfolio/sections/section-background"
- CTABanner from "@/components/portfolio/sections/cta-banner"
- SocialProofDisplay from "@/components/portfolio/social-proof-display"
- CTAButton from "@/components/portfolio/cta-button" (if needed for CalendlyButton styling)
- Keep existing imports: PricingCards, CalendlyButton, FAQSchema, ServiceSchema, useRouter

Run `bun run build`. Services page compiles without errors. Run `bun run dev` and check http://localhost:3400/services:
1. Pricing cards show first with gradient background
2. WordPress CTA is warm/amber, custom inquiry CTAs are blue outline
3. CTA copy is benefit-focused ("Get Your Business Online" not "Book Your $500 Site Call")
4. FAQ has muted background
5. SocialProofDisplay shows trust metrics
6. CTABanner appears at bottom with gradient
  </verify>
  <done>
Services page has pricing-first layout with dual CTA differentiation (warm WordPress vs outline custom), alternating section backgrounds, benefit-focused copy, SocialProofDisplay trust metrics, and end-page CTABanner.

  <name>Task 2: Redesign About page with process focus and Contact page polish</name>
  <files>
    app/about/page.tsx
    app/contact/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**About Page (app/about/page.tsx):**

Rewrite with process & values focus per CONTEXT.md ("how projects work, what clients get, professional values"). The page stays "use client" for CalendlyButton.

**Page structure:**

**Section 1: Hero (neutral)**
- SectionBackground variant="neutral"
- h1: font-serif font-semibold text-h1 leading-tight mb-md - "How I Work"
- Subheadline: text-xl text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto - "A straightforward process focused on getting your business online quickly and professionally."
- Note: CONTEXT.md says "process & values focus", not personal story. Lead with HOW, not WHO.

**Section 2: Process Steps (gradient background)**
- SectionBackground variant="gradient"
- h2: font-serif text-h2 leading-tight text-center mb-xl - "From Idea to Launch in 4 Steps"
- 4-step process grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-lg):
  - Step 1: "Discovery Call" - "We chat for 15 minutes about your business, your goals, and what you need from your website."
  - Step 2: "Content & Design" - "I build your site using your content and brand. You review and request one round of changes."
  - Step 3: "Launch" - "Your site goes live within 5 business days. I handle all the technical details."
  - Step 4: "Ongoing Support" - "30 days of support included. I'm always available if you have questions."
- Each step: Card elevation="sm" with p-lg, centered, numbered badge at top (a small rounded div with step number), h3 font-semibold mb-sm, p text-sm text-muted-foreground

**Section 3: Values (neutral background)**
- SectionBackground variant="neutral"
- h2: font-serif text-h2 leading-tight text-center mb-xl - "What You Can Expect"
- Reuse the existing "Why Work With Me" cards (No Jargon, Fixed Pricing, Real Experience, Ongoing Support) - same content, but wrapped in SectionBackground
- grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-lg, max-w-3xl mx-auto

**Section 4: Background (muted, brief)**
- SectionBackground variant="muted"
- Shorter, more focused version of the background section
- h2: font-serif text-h2 leading-tight mb-md - "A Bit About Me"
- Brief prose (max-w-prose mx-auto): Keep the key narrative about 18+ years experience and the discovery of the gap between "big tech" and local business needs. Remove the detailed career timeline. Focus on: experience -> discovered local businesses need simple solutions -> that's why $500 WordPress sites exist.
- 2-3 paragraphs max

**Section 5: Lighter CTA (no full banner, just a simple CTA block)**
- SectionBackground variant="neutral"
- Per CONTEXT.md: About gets "lighter CTA presence" (not full treatment)
- Simple centered block: h2 font-serif text-h3 mb-md - "Ready to Get Started?"
- p text-muted-foreground mb-lg max-w-xl mx-auto - "Whether you need a quick WordPress site or have a custom project in mind, let's talk."
- Dual CTA row: CTAButton intent="warm" asChild wrapping Link to /services with text "Get Your Business Online" + Button variant="outline" asChild wrapping Link to /projects with text "View My Work"

**Keep:** PersonSchema at the bottom. Quick stats section removed (replaced by process steps and values cards which are more compelling).

**Contact Page (app/contact/page.tsx):**

Lighter enhancements - add visual consistency without major restructuring.

Changes:
1. Wrap the hero section in SectionBackground variant="neutral" for consistent spacing
2. Add SectionBackground variant="muted" around the form/booking grid area
3. Update the heading to be more benefit-focused: "Let's Talk About Your Project" (instead of "Let's Build Something Together" which is reserved for the CTABanner on other pages)
4. Add a very subtle gradient treatment to the "Book a Call Instead" card (add a subtle gradient border or background-linear to distinguish it)
5. Remove the bottom "Typical response time" text and replace with a small trust line integrated into the form card description
6. Keep existing functionality (ContactForm, CalendlyButton, email/GitHub/LinkedIn links)
7. Import SectionBackground from sections

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT add a CTABanner to the contact page (it IS the conversion page)
- Keep both pages as "use client" (CalendlyButton needs DOM access)
- Import SectionBackground, CTAButton, Card, Button, Link as needed
- Use design token spacing throughout

Run `bun run build`. Both pages compile without errors. Run `bun run dev` and check:

About page (http://localhost:3400/about):
1. Hero says "How I Work" with process-focused subheadline
2. 4-step process grid shows on gradient background
3. Values cards ("What You Can Expect") on neutral background
4. Brief background section on muted background
5. Lighter CTA at end (no full-width banner, just centered text + dual CTAs)

Contact page (http://localhost:3400/contact):
1. Consistent section spacing with SectionBackground wrappers
2. Updated heading is benefit-focused
3. Form and booking sections wrapped in muted background
4. Book a Call card has subtle visual distinction
  </verify>
  <done>
About page focuses on process and values (4-step process, "What You Can Expect" cards, brief background) with lighter CTA presence. Contact page has consistent section treatment and updated copy. Both pages use alternating gradient/neutral/muted backgrounds. WordPress CTAs use warm/amber, custom uses outline.
