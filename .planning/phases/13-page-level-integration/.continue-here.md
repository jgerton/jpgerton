Phase 13 planning is complete. All 3 plans created, verified, and committed. Ready to execute.

- Research complete (13-RESEARCH.md)
- Context captured (13-CONTEXT.md from /gsd:discuss-phase)
- 3 plans created (13-01, 13-02, 13-03)
- Plan checker verified all 9 dimensions passed
- No code changes yet - execution not started
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase context discussion (/gsd:discuss-phase) - user decisions captured
- Research phase (gsd-phase-researcher agent) - patterns for page composition, dual CTA strategy, gradient implementation, F-pattern visual hierarchy documented
- Plan creation (gsd-planner agent) - 3 plans in 2 waves
- Plan verification (gsd-plan-checker agent) - all checks passed

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Wave 1:**
- Plan 13-01: Create section components (SectionBackground, CTABanner, HeroWithGradient, MidPageCTA) + restructure home page

**Wave 2 (parallel):**
- Plan 13-02: Apply strategic CTA placement to Services, About, Contact pages
- Plan 13-03: Enhance project pages with case study format + visual verification checkpoint

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

From CONTEXT.md (user decisions):
- Hero: Outcome-first messaging, dual CTA (warm + outline), gradient backdrop, NO social proof in hero
- CTA Strategy: WordPress = warm/amber solid, Custom = blue outline, benefit-focused copy ("Get Your Business Online" not "Book Your $500 Site")
- Placement: Home/Services get full treatment, About/Projects get lighter CTA presence
- Page flow: Home (Hero->Services->Projects->Social Proof->CTA), Services (pricing-first), About (process focus), Projects (case study format)
- Brand differentiation: Alternating gradient/neutral/muted backgrounds, decorative geometric shapes (limited), strategic amber accent

From Research:
- Server Components for pages, Client Components pushed down only for interactivity
- SectionBackground wrapper for consistent py-3xl padding and max-w-7xl centering
- Tailwind v4 gradient syntax: bg-linear-to-br (not bg-gradient-to-br)
- Contrast validation at ALL gradient color stops (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)

<context>
This is the penultimate phase of v1.1 Design Polish. Phase 13 applies all the design system work from Phases 8-12 to create cohesive page experiences. The goal is making the site look like a professional agency portfolio, not a shadcn/ui template.

Key insight: This is composition, not creation. We're orchestrating existing components (CTAButton, TestimonialCard, SocialProofDisplay, CaseStudyVisual, ProjectCardEnhanced) into conversion flows.

Wave 1 (Plan 13-01) creates the foundational section components and restructures the home page. Wave 2 (Plans 13-02 and 13-03) runs in parallel since they modify completely different files (services/about/contact vs projects).

Plan 13-03 includes the visual verification checkpoint covering all pages.

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:execute-phase 13` to execute all 3 plans.

The executor will:
1. Run Plan 13-01 (Wave 1): Create 4 section components + restructure home page
2. Run Plans 13-02 and 13-03 in parallel (Wave 2): Services/About/Contact + Projects pages
3. Pause at visual checkpoint in 13-03 for human verification across all pages
