<current_state>
All 3 plans of Phase 13 have been executed. Code is complete and built successfully.

Plan 13-03 is at Task 2: a human-verify checkpoint awaiting user approval.
The user has NOT yet approved the visual verification. They paused work before reviewing.

All code is committed. Working tree is clean.

<completed_work>

**Plan 13-01 (Wave 1): Section Components + Home Page** - COMPLETE
- Created 4 section components: SectionBackground, CTABanner, HeroWithGradient, MidPageCTA
- Restructured home page with 5-section conversion flow
- Commits: 6aec92c, 6df795a, 82becec (summary doc)

**Plan 13-02 (Wave 2): Services/About/Contact Pages** - COMPLETE
- Services page: pricing-first layout, dual CTA differentiation (warm WordPress, blue outline custom)
- About page: "How I Work" process-first layout, 4-step grid, lighter CTA
- Contact page: polished with SectionBackground wrappers, no CTABanner (it IS the conversion page)
- Commits: 50341df, cc64079, c4dbe87 (summary doc)

**Plan 13-03 Task 1: Projects Pages** - COMPLETE
- Projects index: SectionBackground wrappers, subtle bottom CTA
- Project detail: CaseStudyVisual section (Challenge/Approach/Impact), lighter end-page CTA
- Commit: 997ca9f

**Plan 13-03 Task 2: Visual Verification Checkpoint** - AWAITING USER
- 28-point checklist covering all pages in light/dark mode and mobile
- User needs to run `bun run dev` and verify at localhost:3400

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

1. **User visual verification** (checkpoint Task 2 of 13-03)
   - User reviews all pages per the 28-point checklist in 13-03-PLAN.md
   - User types "approved" or reports issues

2. **Create 13-03-SUMMARY.md** after checkpoint approval

3. **Phase verification** (gsd-verifier agent)
   - Verify phase goal achievement across all 3 plans

4. **Update state files**
   - ROADMAP.md: mark Phase 13 complete
   - STATE.md: update to Phase 14 / 100% if done
   - REQUIREMENTS.md: check off completed requirements

5. **Phase completion commit**
   - `docs(13): complete page-level-integration phase`

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Tailwind v4 gradient syntax: bg-linear-to-br (not bg-gradient-to-br)
- Server Components for SectionBackground, CTABanner, MidPageCTA; Client Component only for HeroWithGradient
- Benefit-focused CTA copy: "Get Your Business Online" not "Book Your $500 Site"
- WordPress CTA always warm/amber solid fill, custom inquiry always blue outline
- About page leads with "How I Work" process, not personal story
- Contact page gets no CTABanner (it IS the conversion page)
- Featured projects limited to 3 on home page via .slice(0, 3)
- CalendlyButton styled with warm accent via className override
- About page uses CTAButton linking to /services instead of CalendlyButton for lighter CTA
- Case study data derived from existing project fields (no schema changes)

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - all code is complete and building. Just needs visual verification.
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 13 applies the complete design system (Phases 8-12) across all public pages. This is composition, not creation - orchestrating existing components into conversion flows.

The execution went smoothly with zero errors. All 3 plans executed in 2 waves using gsd-executor agents. The only remaining step is the human visual verification checkpoint, which the user paused before completing.

After Phase 13, only Phase 14 (Final QA & Polish) remains for v1.1 completion.

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:resume-work`. The resume workflow should:

1. Run `bun run dev` to start the dev server
2. Present the 28-point visual verification checklist from 13-03-PLAN.md Task 2
3. Wait for user to approve or report issues
4. On approval: create 13-03-SUMMARY.md, run phase verification, update state files, commit
</next_action>
