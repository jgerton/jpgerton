# Phase 13: Page-Level Integration - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Apply the complete design system (tokens, components, animations) across all public-facing pages with strategic CTA placement, visual hierarchy guiding the conversion flow, and professional visual elements that differentiate from generic templates. This phase uses existing components from Phases 8-12 and integrates them into cohesive page experiences.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Redesign
- Outcome-first messaging: lead with the value proposition directly (not problem or credibility)
- Dual CTA: primary conversion button + secondary exploration button (e.g., "See My Work")
- Gradient backdrop behind hero text: bold brand gradient (blue to accent), modern and eye-catching
- No social proof in hero: keep it clean and focused on value prop, proof follows in the next section

### CTA Strategy
- WordPress $500 CTA: warm/amber solid fill button (benefit-focused copy)
- Custom inquiry CTA: blue outline button (benefit-focused copy)
- Maximum differentiation: color coding + style coding combined
- Copy tone: benefit-focused ("Get Your Business Online" not "Book Your $500 Site"), focus on what the visitor gets
- Placement: page-appropriate, not uniform. Home/Services get full treatment (above fold + mid-page + end-page). About/Projects get lighter CTA presence
- End-of-page CTA: full-width banner section with gradient background, large text, and prominent button

### Page Flow & Hierarchy
- **Home page order:** Hero -> Services overview -> Featured projects -> Social proof / testimonials -> CTA banner
- **Services page:** Pricing table focus first (transparency), then what's included, FAQ, booking CTA. Price-first approach.
- **About page:** Process & values focus (how projects work, what clients get, professional values). Professional trust over personal story.
- **Project detail pages:** Case study format with challenge/approach/impact narrative. Demonstrates thinking, not just output.

### Brand Differentiation
- Gradient section backgrounds: alternating gradient and neutral section backgrounds throughout pages, creating visual rhythm
- Section separation: clean spacing only (generous whitespace, no explicit dividers). Alternating backgrounds create natural separation.
- Decorative elements: subtle geometric shapes (abstract circles, lines, dots) as background accents for depth
- Amber/gold accent: strategic highlights only. Reserved for WordPress CTAs and key metrics. Makes accent moments stand out by not overusing.

### Claude's Discretion
- Specific gradient color stops and direction
- Geometric shape placement and sizing
- Exact section padding values (within token scale)
- Which projects to feature on home page
- Mid-page CTA component design
- Mobile layout adaptations for section ordering

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Services first on home page: show what's offered before proving it with work samples
- Case study format on project pages signals deeper thinking than a simple portfolio grid
- Full-width CTA banners at page end serve as strong closers with gradient treatment
- Alternating section backgrounds (gradient/neutral) replace the need for explicit dividers
