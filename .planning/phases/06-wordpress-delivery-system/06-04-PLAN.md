<objective>
Create Scope Control and Payment Protection documentation that protects Jon's time and ensures profitable project delivery.

Purpose: Scope creep and payment issues kill service business profitability. These documents establish clear boundaries upfront: what's included, what costs extra, and when money is due.

Output: `docs/wordpress-delivery/04-scope-control-template.md` for scope boundaries, `docs/wordpress-delivery/05-payment-protection.md` for payment terms, and `docs/wordpress-delivery/templates/change-order-form.md` for handling scope extensions.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write Scope Control Template</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/04-scope-control-template.md</files>
  <action>
Create comprehensive scope control documentation covering:

**1. What's Included in $500 Package**

Deliverables:
- 5-7 page website (Home, About, Services, Contact, Privacy Policy + optional 2)
- Contact form with email notification
- Mobile responsive design
- Basic SEO setup (titles, descriptions, sitemap submission)
- Google Maps embed (if physical location)
- Click-to-call phone link
- Social media links
- 30-day bug fix warranty

Design:
- Professional layout using Kadence Starter Template as base
- Client logo placement (client provides logo)
- Brand color application
- Stock photos from free sources OR client-provided photos
- 2 revision rounds on design/content

Content:
- Claude-assisted content drafting from questionnaire/call
- OR formatting of client-provided content
- 2 revision rounds on content

**2. What's NOT Included (Explicit Exclusions)**
- E-commerce/online store functionality
- Custom functionality or plugins beyond standard stack
- Blog setup beyond basic page (no content calendar)
- Ongoing maintenance or updates after launch
- Photography or professional logo design
- Domain registration (client responsibility)
- Hosting fees (client responsibility)
- Email setup (client responsibility, can advise)
- More than 2 revision rounds
- Content writing beyond initial drafts
- Additional pages beyond 7

**3. Change Request Process**
Philosophy: Never say "no" - say "yes, and here's what it costs"

Process:
1. Client requests something outside scope
2. Jon acknowledges and quotes additional cost
3. Written approval required before starting work
4. Change order form signed (link to template)
5. Additional payment due before additional work begins

**4. Common Add-On Pricing**
| Request | Typical Price | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Additional page | $75/page | Same style, simple content |
| Blog setup | $150 | Includes 1 sample post, category setup |
| E-commerce (basic) | $500+ | Requires separate quote |
| Additional revision round | $75/round | Or $50/hour, client choice |
| Photo sourcing | $50 | Finding/purchasing stock photos |
| Logo design | Refer out | Not Jon's service |
| Ongoing maintenance | $75/month | Optional retainer |

**5. Contract Language Suggestions**
Include sample clauses for:
- Scope definition
- Change order requirement
- Approval requirements
- Timeline impacts of changes
  </action>
  <verify>File contains: deliverables list, explicit exclusions, change request process, add-on pricing, contract language</verify>
  <done>Scope Control Template clearly defines what's included and how to handle changes</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write Payment Protection Documentation</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/05-payment-protection.md</files>
  <action>
Create payment protection documentation covering:

**1. Payment Structure**
- 50% upfront before any work begins ($250)
- 50% before launch/migration ($250)
- NO launch until final payment received
- Payment via Stripe invoice (links sent via email)

**2. Payment Timeline**
| Milestone | Payment Due | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Contract signed | 50% deposit | $250 |
| Site approved on staging | 50% final | $250 |
| Final payment cleared | Site goes live | - |

**3. What Happens If**
- Client disappears after deposit: Work pauses, deposit non-refundable, files archived after 60 days
- Client delays approval: Timeline extends, Jon moves to other projects
- Client requests launch before payment: Polite decline, staging remains password-protected
- Client disputes payment: Site stays on staging, no migration

**4. 30-Day Bug Fix Warranty**

What IS covered:
- Functionality that worked at launch but stopped working
- Display issues appearing in same browser/device as tested
- Form submissions not arriving (if WP Mail SMTP configured correctly)
- Broken links discovered post-launch

What is NOT covered:
- Content changes or updates
- New features or functionality
- Design revisions or "I changed my mind"
- Issues caused by client/third-party changes
- Hosting or domain issues
- Plugin conflicts from client-added plugins
- Anything outside original scope

**5. Support Boundaries**
- Bug reports via email only (not text, not phone)
- 1-2 business day response time
- Support ends after 30 days
- Ongoing support available via monthly retainer ($75/month)

**6. Sample Payment Reminder Templates**
Include email templates for:
- Initial invoice with deposit request
- Final payment request (site ready for approval)
- Payment reminder (gentle)
- Final notice (site will be archived)

**7. Why This Protects Both Parties**
- Jon doesn't work for free
- Client has leverage (final payment unlocks launch)
- Clear warranty prevents support scope creep
- Written terms prevent misunderstandings
  </action>
  <verify>File contains: payment structure, timeline table, warranty definition, support boundaries, email templates</verify>
  <done>Payment Protection documentation enforces 50% upfront and defines warranty boundaries</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create Change Order Form Template</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/templates/change-order-form.md</files>
  <action>
