<objective>
Create the Content Workflow documentation and Client Questionnaire template that guide the intake-to-approval process for $500 WordPress projects.

Purpose: Jon needs a repeatable content process that handles clients who bring varying levels of content (nothing, headlines only, or full copy). The questionnaire collects basics upfront; Claude handles the heavy lifting of drafting.

Output: `docs/wordpress-delivery/02-content-workflow.md` with workflow steps, and `docs/wordpress-delivery/templates/client-questionnaire.md` as a reusable intake form.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Client Questionnaire Template</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/templates/client-questionnaire.md</files>
  <action>
Create the client intake questionnaire covering:

**Business Basics**
- Business Name
- Business Type (e.g., landscaping, cleaning, plumbing)
- Years in business
- Location/service area

**Contact Information**
- Owner/contact name
- Email
- Phone
- Physical address (for Google Maps)

**Services**
- List main services (3-5)
- Service descriptions (1-2 sentences each)
- Pricing approach (list prices? "call for quote"? packages?)

**Brand & Style**
- Existing logo? (request file)
- Brand colors (if known)
- Competitor websites they like (or don't like)
- Tone preference (professional, friendly, casual)

**Content Assets**
- Existing photos? (request folder/link)
- Testimonials/reviews they want featured?
- Certifications/licenses to display?
- Awards or notable clients?

**Website Goals**
- Primary goal (phone calls? form submissions? both?)
- Call to action preference ("Call Now", "Get a Free Quote", etc.)
- Hours of operation
- Social media links (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)

**Optional Extras**
- FAQ questions they commonly answer
- "About" story they want told
- Team members to feature?

Format as a clean markdown template that can be:
1. Copied into a Google Doc for clients who prefer that
2. Sent as email questions
3. Used as a call script during discovery call
  </action>
  <verify>File exists with all sections covering business basics, services, brand, content assets, and goals</verify>
  <done>Client questionnaire template is complete and covers all intake needs</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write Content Workflow Documentation</name>
  <files>docs/wordpress-delivery/02-content-workflow.md</files>
  <action>
Create comprehensive content workflow documentation covering:

**1. Intake Phase**
- Send questionnaire (link to templates/client-questionnaire.md)
- Schedule 15-20 minute discovery call to fill gaps
- Collect any existing content/photos client has

**2. Claude-Assisted Drafting**
Document three scenarios:

Scenario A: Client provides nothing
- Use questionnaire + call notes
- Claude drafts full page copy for all pages
- Include prompts Jon can use with Claude for each page type

Scenario B: Client provides headlines/bullet points
- Claude expands into full paragraphs
- Maintains client's voice and key points
- Jon reviews for accuracy

Scenario C: Client provides full content
- Claude polishes for web (shorter paragraphs, scannable)
- Jon reviews for SEO opportunities
- Minimal rewriting, mostly formatting

**3. Review Cycle**
- 2 revision rounds included in $500
- What counts as a "revision": tweaks to existing deliverables
- What does NOT count: new pages, major scope changes, new features
- Additional revisions: $75/round or $50/hour (client choice)

**4. Content Delays**
- Timeline pauses if client doesn't provide content on time
- No penalty, but they lose their spot in queue
- Clear communication template for "waiting on content" message

**5. Approval Process**
- Client reviews content on staging preview link
- Written approval required before moving to launch phase
- Approval email template

Include example Claude prompts Jon can use for:
- Home page hero section
- About page narrative
- Services descriptions
- Contact page intro
  </action>
  <verify>File contains: intake steps, 3 Claude scenarios, revision policy, delay policy, approval process</verify>
  <done>Content workflow documentation covers complete intake-to-approval process with Claude integration</done>
</task>
