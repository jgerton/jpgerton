<objective>
Create the Handoff Checklist and Client Training Guide template for professional project delivery.

Purpose: The handoff is the last impression Jon makes. A smooth handoff with clear documentation makes the $500 feel like a $2000 service. The training guide and Loom walkthrough prevent support requests.

Output: `docs/wordpress-delivery/06-handoff-checklist.md` for Jon's internal process, and `docs/wordpress-delivery/templates/client-training-guide-template.md` that gets customized for each client.
