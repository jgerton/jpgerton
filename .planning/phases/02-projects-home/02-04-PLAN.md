  <name>Task 1: Create Convex seed mutation for projects</name>

Create convex/seed.ts with a mutation to seed 6 indie projects.

Use realistic placeholder data - actual project details will be refined later via admin dashboard:

```typescript
import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";

export const seedProjects = mutation({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    // Check if projects already exist to avoid duplicates
    const existing = await ctx.db.query("projects").first();
    if (existing) {

Key decisions:
- 6 diverse projects with varying statuses (in-progress, live, archived)
- No screenshots initially - images will be uploaded via admin dashboard in Phase 4
- Realistic tech stacks showing breadth of skills
- displayOrder for sorting (6 = most recent, 1 = oldest)
- featured flag for 3 projects to show on home

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Run seed mutation to populate database</name>
  <files>(none - Convex operation)</files>
  <action>
Run the seed mutation to populate the Convex database:

Option 1 - Via Convex CLI:
```bash
bunx convex run seed:seedProjects
```

Option 2 - Via Convex Dashboard:
1. Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select the jpgerton project
3. Navigate to Functions
4. Find seed:seedProjects
5. Click "Run" with empty args {}

Verify the data:
1. In Convex Dashboard, go to Data tab
2. Select "projects" table
3. Confirm 6 rows exist with expected data

If seed fails or you need to re-run:
```bash
bunx convex run seed:clearProjects
bunx convex run seed:seedProjects
```
  </action>
  <verify>Convex Dashboard shows 6 projects in projects table</verify>
  <done>6 projects exist in Convex database</done>
