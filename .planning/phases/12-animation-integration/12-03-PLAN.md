<objective>
Verify all Phase 12 animation work in the browser and confirm Lighthouse scores are maintained.

Purpose: Animation quality can only be verified visually. This checkpoint ensures the motion feels "refined and confident" (not bouncy, not sluggish), stagger timing is subtle, reduced-motion works correctly, and Lighthouse performance is preserved.

Output: Verified animation system ready for Phase 13 page integration.

  <name>Task 1: Run build and Lighthouse audit</name>

  <action>
1. Run `bun run build` to confirm production build succeeds with no errors or warnings related to the animation changes.

2. Start the dev server with `bun run dev` and verify the application loads correctly.

3. Use the Chrome extension to navigate to the home page (http://localhost:3400) and take a screenshot to capture the current visual state.

4. Check browser console for any errors or warnings related to Intersection Observer or animation.

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 12 animation system:
1. **Button press feedback**: All buttons scale down to 97% on click/press, spring back smoothly on release
2. **Focus ring animation**: Keyboard focus rings animate in smoothly (150ms) instead of appearing instantly
3. **Scroll entrance animations**: Project cards fade up with staggered timing when scrolling into view on the home page
4. **Section heading animation**: "Recent Projects" heading animates in when scrolled to
5. **prefers-reduced-motion**: All animations disabled for users with motion sensitivity preference
6. **Existing hover states preserved**: Card shadow lift, button gradient shimmer, image zoom, nav link underline all still work
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Test in browser at http://localhost:3400:**

1. **Button press (any page):**
   - Click and HOLD any button (e.g., "Get Your $500 Site" on home page)
   - Observe: button should subtly shrink while held, then spring back when released
   - Test on both primary and outline variants

2. **Focus ring (any page, use keyboard):**
   - Press Tab to navigate between interactive elements
   - Observe: focus ring should fade in smoothly, not appear instantly

3. **Scroll entrance (home page):**
   - Load the home page - hero section should be immediately visible (NO fade-in)
   - Scroll down to the "Recent Projects" section
   - Observe: heading should fade up into view
   - Observe: project cards should fade up one by one with ~50ms delay between each
   - Scroll back up, then back down - cards should NOT re-animate (once only)

4. **Existing hover states (home page):**
   - Hover over a project card - should lift with shadow increase and scale
   - Hover over project card image - should slowly zoom in
   - Hover over nav links - underline should slide in from left

5. **prefers-reduced-motion:**
   - Enable "Reduce motion" in your OS accessibility settings
     - Windows: Settings > Accessibility > Visual effects > Animation effects (off)
     - macOS: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion (on)
   - Reload the home page
   - All content should be immediately visible (no fade-in, no entrance animations)
   - Buttons should NOT scale on press
   - Card hovers should still change color but NOT scale/lift
   - Re-enable animations after testing

6. **Performance check:**
   - The site should feel fast and responsive
   - No jank or stuttering during scroll animations
   - No layout shifts caused by animations

  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all animations look correct, or describe any issues you see.</resume-signal>
