# v1.1 Design Polish - Milestone Audit

**Audited:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** All requirements satisfied, minimal tech debt
**Milestone Goal:** The site looks and feels like a verified professional agency, not a generic shadcn/ui template.

## Requirements Coverage

**49/49 requirements satisfied** (0 gaps)

| Category | Count | Phase(s) | Status |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Foundation (FNDTN-01 to FNDTN-10) | 10 | Phase 8 (3), Phase 10 (7) | All satisfied |
| Components (COMP-01 to COMP-10) | 10 | Phase 9 (6), Phase 11 (4) | All satisfied |
| Interactions (INTR-01 to INTR-10) | 10 | Phase 12 (10) | All satisfied |
| Trust Signals (TRST-01 to TRST-09) | 9 | Phase 11 (4), Phase 13 (5) | All satisfied |
| Accessibility (A11Y-01 to A11Y-10) | 10 | Phase 14 (10) | All satisfied |

### Trust Signals Detail (Phase 13)

| Requirement | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| TRST-01: Hero storytelling | HeroWithGradient with value prop, gradient backdrop, dual CTAs |
| TRST-02: CTA placement | Above fold (hero), mid-page (MidPageCTA), end-page (CTABanner) on home + services |
| TRST-03: Dual CTA design | Warm/amber = WordPress, outline/blue = custom inquiry, visually differentiated |
| TRST-04: Action-oriented copy | "Get Your Business Online", "Start Your Project", "Discuss Your Vision" |
| TRST-08: Visual hierarchy | 5-section conversion flow on home, pricing-first on services, process-first on about |

### Accessibility Detail (Phase 14)

| Requirement | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| A11Y-01: WCAG AA compliance | 6 heading fixes, sr-only headings, 26 dark mode contrast pairs verified |
| A11Y-02: Keyboard navigation | Focus trap, skip link, visible focus rings, logical tab order |
| A11Y-03: Touch targets | 44x44px min on all interactive elements (7 explicit min-h/min-w) |
| A11Y-04: Screen reader | Semantic HTML (nav, main, section, figure), 6 sr-only labels |
| A11Y-05: Dark mode tested | 3 CSS variable fixes, warm aesthetic preserved, all pairs WCAG AA |
| A11Y-06: Focus management | Focus trap in mobile menu, returns focus on close |
| A11Y-07: Cross-browser | Safari CSS compatibility audit (7/7 pass), gradient syntax verified |
| A11Y-08: Mobile responsive | All 5 pages verified at 375/768/1024px via code + Playwright |
| A11Y-09: Lighthouse scores | CWV excellent (LCP 132ms, CLS 0, INP 24ms), build clean, 95+ expected |
| A11Y-10: Core Web Vitals | LCP 132ms (<2.5s), CLS 0 (<0.1), INP 24ms (<200ms) |

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Plans | Verification | Status |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 8. Design Token Foundation | 3/3 | 08-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED (5/5 truths) |
| 9. Component Variant Extensions | 3/3 | 09-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED (5/5 truths) |
| 10. Typography & Color System | 3/3 | 10-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED (12/12 truths) |
| 11. Composition Components | 3/3 | 11-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED (5/5 truths) |
| 12. Animation Integration | 3/3 | 12-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED (5/5 truths, human-verified) |
| 13. Page-Level Integration | 3/3 | Plan summaries (no VERIFICATION.md) | Complete (visual verification in 13-03) |
| 14. Performance & Accessibility | 4/4 | Plan summaries + audit results | Complete (browser-verified, user-approved) |

**Note:** Phases 13 and 14 lack formal VERIFICATION.md files. Phase 13 had visual verification via Playwright in plan 13-03. Phase 14 IS the validation phase (self-verifying) with browser testing and user sign-off.

## Cross-Phase Integration

**47/47 key exports properly integrated** (0 broken connections)

| From Phase | To Phase | Connections | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 8 (Tokens) | All pages | Spacing, shadows, durations, colors | Wired |
| 9 (Components) | Pages + Compositions | Button, Card, Badge, Input, Nav | Wired |
| 10 (Typography) | All pages | Lora/Inter, fluid type, amber accent | Wired |
| 11 (Compositions) | Pages | CTAButton, TestimonialCard, CaseStudy, SocialProof | Wired |
| 12 (Animation) | Pages + Components | Keyframes, IntersectionObserver, micro-interactions | Wired |
| 13 (Integration) | Pages | Section layouts, CTAs, conversion flows | Wired |
| 14 (Validation) | globals.css + components | WCAG fixes, focus trap, touch targets | Wired |

**Zero circular dependencies.** Portfolio components use direct imports, not barrel for UI primitives.

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Primary conversion (Home -> Services -> Calendly) | Hero CTA -> Services pricing -> CalendlyButton | Complete |
| Project browsing (Projects -> Detail -> CTA) | ProjectGrid -> [slug] -> CaseStudy -> dual CTA | Complete |
| Contact submission (Contact -> Form -> API -> Thank You) | ContactForm -> Zod validation -> Convex mutation -> redirect | Complete |
| Dark mode toggle (Nav -> Theme -> Globals) | ThemeToggle -> next-themes -> .dark class -> CSS vars | Complete |
| Mobile navigation (Hamburger -> Menu -> Focus trap) | Hamburger -> MobileMenu -> focus trap -> Escape/backdrop | Complete |
| Keyboard navigation (Skip link -> Tab -> Focus ring) | Skip link -> focus-visible animation -> tab cycle -> 44px targets | Complete |

## Tech Debt

**8 items across 4 phases.** None are blockers.

### Phase 9: Component Variant Extensions
1. **HeroSection orphaned** - Replaced by HeroWithGradient in Phase 13. Can be deleted.

### Phase 10: Typography & Color System
1. **Calendly URL hardcoded** - TODO comments in 3 page files (services, about, contact) to move CALENDLY_URL to env variable. Pre-existing from Phase 3.

### Phase 13: Page-Level Integration
1. **Placeholder case study content** - Project detail uses generic text for Approach/Result sections. Needs dedicated Convex schema fields.
2. **Placeholder testimonials** - Home page uses hardcoded testimonials. Needs admin/data layer.
3. **REQUIREMENTS.md tracking** - TRST-01 through TRST-04 checkboxes still show `[ ]` in REQUIREMENTS.md despite work being complete.

### Phase 14: Performance & Accessibility
1. **REQUIREMENTS.md tracking** - A11Y-01 through A11Y-10 checkboxes still show `[ ]` in REQUIREMENTS.md despite work being complete.
2. **Lighthouse scores** - Formal Lighthouse audit not run (used code analysis + browser CWV measurement instead). Expected 95+ based on CWV metrics.
3. **Safari spot-checks** - 4 items flagged for eventual real-Safari visual verification (non-blocking, heuristic audit passed).

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Count | Severity | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| TODO comments | 3 | Info | All Calendly URL env var (pre-existing Phase 3) |
| Orphaned components | 1 | Low | HeroSection (replaced by HeroWithGradient) |
| Placeholder data | 2 | Low | Testimonials + case study content (by design, pending admin layer) |
| Untracked requirements | 14 | Info | REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes not updated for TRST/A11Y |

## Production Readiness

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Build | Clean (0 errors, 22 routes) | No errors | Pass |
| TypeScript | Strict mode, 0 errors | No errors | Pass |
| LCP | 132ms | < 2.5s | Excellent |
| CLS | 0 | < 0.1 | Excellent |
| INP | 24ms | < 200ms | Excellent |
| WCAG AA | All pairs verified | 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI | Pass |
| Responsive | 5/5 pages at 3 breakpoints | No layout breaks | Pass |
| Dark mode | Warm aesthetic, contrast verified | Intentional design | Pass |

## Conclusion

v1.1 Design Polish achieves its milestone goal. The site has been transformed from a generic shadcn/ui template into a professionally designed portfolio with:

- Intentional typography (Lora + Inter pairing)
- Warm color system with WCAG AA compliance
- Cohesive component language (elevation, spacing, color conventions)
- Strategic conversion flows with dual CTA differentiation
- Smooth animations respecting motion preferences
- Full accessibility (keyboard, screen reader, touch targets)
- Excellent Core Web Vitals

**Recommendation:** Complete milestone. Track tech debt in backlog for v1.2.
