## Tech Debt

Non-critical items accumulated during milestone. No blockers.

### Phase 15: Content Schema + Backend
- `unpublish` and `restore` mutations exist in both blogPosts and caseStudies but no admin UI buttons yet (can be called via Convex dashboard)

### Phase 16: Admin Content Management
- Pre-existing lint warnings in useIntersectionObserver ref access pattern (false positive from v1.1, correct implementation)

### Phase 17: Public Blog Pages
- `caseStudies.listPublished` and `caseStudies.getBySlug` queries exist but no public /case-studies index page (backend ready for future milestone)

### Phase 18: Content Integration
- Testimonials seed mutation must be run manually via Convex dashboard to populate initial data
- No admin CRUD UI for testimonials (deferred to future milestone, managed via Convex dashboard)

**Total: 5 items across 4 phases (all non-blocking)**

## Backend Function Coverage

| Module | Functions | With UI Consumer | Available Only |

| caseStudies | 13 | 10 | 3 (listPublished, getBySlug, unpublish, restore) |
| testimonials | 2 | 1 | 1 (seed) |

**38/42 backend functions actively consumed by UI. 4 available for future features.**

## Build Status
