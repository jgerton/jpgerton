## Pre-Launch Actions Required

Before the site goes fully live, these items need attention:

2. **Create favicon** (favicon.ico and apple-touch-icon.png)
3. **Set NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID** in Vercel environment variables
4. **Remove noindex** meta tag for production
5. **Move CALENDLY_URL** to environment variable
6. **Move notification email** to environment variable
7. **Fill contract placeholders** (phone number, state)
8. **Verify GitHub settings** (default branch, branch protection)

## Conclusion

Milestone v1 is functionally complete. All 57 requirements are satisfied. All 6 E2E user flows verified end-to-end. Cross-phase integration is solid with 45+ connections verified and 0 broken links. The 13 tech debt items are all non-blocking configuration and documentation items that should be addressed before production launch but do not prevent milestone completion.
